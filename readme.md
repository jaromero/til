## Today I Learned

Just random stuff.

### Quick start

(Requires ruby, node.js/io.js, npm, gulp and bower)

1. `$ bundle install`
2. `$ npm install`
3. `$ bower install`
4. `$ gulp serve` runs a webserver and opens your default browser
5. `$ gulp build` runs jekyll to build the site into `dest`
6. `$ gulp deploy` runs jekyll and deploys using [gulp-subtree](https://github.com/Snugug/gulp-subtree) straight into your `gh-pages` branch
