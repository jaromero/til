Just random stuff.

### Quick start

(Requires ruby, node.js/io.js, npm, gulp and bower)

1. `$ npm install`
2. `$ bower install`
3. `$ gulp serve` runs a webserver and opens your browser
4. `$ gulp build` runs jekyll to build the site into `dest`
5. `$ gulp deploy` runs jekyll and deploys using [gulp-subtree](https://github.com/Snugug/gulp-subtree)
